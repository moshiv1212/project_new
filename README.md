## How It Works

This Scrum management web tool is built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The frontend leverages the power of Chart.js for visually representing project data.

The application uses local storage to securely store project information on the user's device. This ensures data persistence between sessions, allowing users to seamlessly resume their Scrum activities.
